The Odin Project. Foundations. Project: Landing Page.

This repo is created for education purposes. The task was given by "The Odin Project", which I currently participate in. The mission is to landing a simple wepbage, using intermediate HTML/CSS skills. I am expected to use flexbox and/or other models of the landing page. Likewise, I want to practice SCSS/SASS. Using meta tags and responsive design. Maybe a bit of animations and primitive design (such as own fonts or images). Let's see what I am able to do!
